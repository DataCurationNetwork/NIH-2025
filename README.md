# Workshop Site for NIH 2025 Workshops

As part of the continuation of the IMLS funded project “[Developing Specialized
Data Curation Training to Address Needed Expertise in Focused
Areas](https://datacurationnetwork.org/expanding-curation-training/)”, the Data
Curation Network is partnering with the National Institutes of Health to offer a
series of data curation workshops on specialized topics.

This repo provides a Github Pages site with logistics, references, and other
useful resources for workshop participants: https://datacurationnetwork.github.io/NIH-2025/

## Updating the Bibliography

The references for the workshop are managed through Zotero group library: [DCN
Simulation and Code Curriculum
Development](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4927727/dcn_simulation_and_code_curriculum_development). 

To update the bibliography page on the site:
- Use the 'Export Library' to update `codesim/references.bib`, which is a BibTex file.
- Rebuild the site, commit, and push.
