### Resources

::: {.callout-note}
Participants are encouraged to review [DCN's CURATE(D) workflow](https://datacurationnetwork.org/outputs/workflows/) before the first session.
:::

- Pre-workshop preparation
   - GIS  
      - Download and install [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html).  
      - Download the 1_Environment_Setup_Datasets.zip adapted from [Kramer et al 2019](https://doi.org/10.13020/znag-tn48).  
      - Please see the 01_Environmental_Setup slide deck for more details (through slide 5).  
      - If you feel adventurous, try to open any part of the setup dataset in QGIS.  
   - Scientific Images  
      - Download and install [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads) to be used to manipulate scientific images. Specifically we will use Fiji which is a distribution of ImageJ that includes additional useful plugins.
         - Windows users are recommended to install in the users directory where it will have permissions to update itself.  
         - Mac users - the software may run through Rosetta if you have a newer M-series processor, this can have some performance cost. Alternatively you can download a [java version](https://forum.image.sc/t/fiji-clij-etc-native-on-apple-silicon-arm64-m1/53627/25) which can run natively.
