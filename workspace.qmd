::: {.callout-note}
Workshop participants should have received an email with login details for 
their workspace. The instructions below assume you are logged in to the 
website as described in the email
:::

Your workspace is a virtual machine preloaded with the software and datasets
we will use in the workshop. After logging in, you should see a single running
workspace. Click the workspace on the list to use it.

On the workspace page, you will see several buttons: "File Browser", "VS Code
Web", and "Terminal".

During the workshop, we will mostly use VS Code: this is a browser-based 
variant of the popular desktop IDE. Clicking "VS Code web" should open a new
browser window running the application.

When you first start, VS Code it will ask if "you trust the authors of the 
files in this folder?" (Don't worry! You won't be running any code on your 
personal computer-- only on the workspace VM). Click "Yes, I trust the authors."

On the left-hand side of the VS Code window you should see several folders with
the datasets we will use in the workshop:

- `code-Adeodu_2024`
- `code-Azzolin_2023`
- `code-Lu_2020`
- `sim-Do_2020`
- `sim-Munoz_2020`
- `sim-Yang_2019`

If you can see these folder, then you're all set! If you can't, please email
the conference organizers (just reply to the email with your login details).
